**Reflection**

I chose to redesign my mom’s company website, ParentCo, using the simplified design features I admired on CurlMix. To create the redesign, I used the inspect feature to analyze the CSS and HTML code of desired elements and adapted them into a template built with Bootstrap. The key features I focused on were the announcement bar, the automatic video element in the hero section, and the automatic carousel, all of which stood out for their functionality and visual appeal. For the announcement bar, I used Bootstrap’s structure combined with internal CSS to create a ticker effect that scrolls smoothly, providing motion and timing for the displayed announcements. In the hero section, I embedded a fullscreen YouTube video using Bootstrap’s container-fluid and ratio utilities to ensure it expands across the screen and maintains responsiveness on all devices. For the carousel, I utilized Bootstrap’s carousel component to present images dynamically, centering them within the layout and enabling automatic slide transitions for a seamless viewing experience. These features were inspired by CurlMix and tailored to meet the needs of ParentCo, resulting in a modern, responsive design that enhances user engagement.
